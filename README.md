### Hi there 👋
I'm a super confused developer who is constantly switching lanes between frontend & fullstack, some personal projects and sleeping for an entire day because some piece is always missing which could make my code clean and better.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Espressobar](https://github.com/ilakshay14/espressobar) -  a dream cafe where I would love to sit in, have Cold Brew and code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GraphQL, Optimizing React apps, (trying to ) clean and better code. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something where I can play in the area of awesome and smooth frontends.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with cleaning up my code and making it better.
- 💬 Ask me about Frontend with ReactJS, UI/UX and Dark Souls 3. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Visit my [site](https://lakshay.xyz/)?
- ⚡ Fun fact - It's never enough. You cannot stop exploring, learning and experimenting. There is always something (and someone) better out there. So might as well have fun in whatever you are doing.

Cheers! :tumbler_glass:
