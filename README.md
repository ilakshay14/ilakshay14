### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a super confused developer who is constantly switching lanes between frontend & fullstack, some personal projects and sleeping for an entire day because some piece is always missing which could make my code clean and better.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to build a product which everyone can use in their day to day life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI design, Micro Frontends with React, how to design a federated GraphQL backend.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with cleaning up my code and making it better.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Frontend with ReactJS, UI/UX and Dark Souls 3. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Visit my [site](https://lakshay.xyz/)?
- âš¡ Fun fact - It's never enough. You cannot stop exploring, learning and experimenting. There is always something (and someone) better out there. So might as well have fun in whatever you are doing.

Cheers! :tumbler_glass:
