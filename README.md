### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a super confused developer who is constantly switching lanes between frontend & fullstack, some personal projects and sleeping for an entire day because some piece is always missing which could make my code clean and better.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on (Espressobar)[https://github.com/ilakshay14/espressobar] -  a dream cafe where I would love to sit in, have Cold Brew and code.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GraphQL, Optimizing React apps, (trying to ) clean and better code. 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something where I can play in the area of awesome and smooth frontends.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with cleaning up my code and making it better.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Frontend with ReactJS, UI/UX and Dark Souls 3. 
ðŸ“« How to reach me? Visit my (site)[https://lakshay.xyz/]?
âš¡ Fun fact - It's never enough. You cannot stop exploring, learning and experimenting. There is always something (and someone) better out there. So might as well have fun in whatever you are doing.

Cheers! :tumbler_glass:
